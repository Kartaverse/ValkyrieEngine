Welcome to the development repo for Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ â€” The new [Kartaverse 6](https://github.com/kartaverse) hybrid volumetric renderer for pixel-streaming XR experiences without limits.

The "Kartaverse Cloud" reboot is planned for Dec 24, 2024.

If you'd like to, you can follow along at home with your own DIY prototype "Sprucetron" XPU rendering appliance... that is built with open-source software at the core, off-the-shelf parts, and a rugged spruce frame.

Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ ships with LuaJIT scripting support enabled by default since it's awesome and I wouldn't want to leave home without it. ðŸ¤˜
