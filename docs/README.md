Welcome to Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ â€” The new [Kartaverse 6](https://github.com/kartaverse) hybrid volumetric renderer for pixel-streaming XR experiences without limits.

- True resolution independence has never looked so good
- Made in West Dover, Nova Scotia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- The "Kartaverse Cloud" reboot is planned for [Dec 24, 2024](https://days.to/christmas-eve/2024/12/24)

If you'd like to, you can follow along at home during this development journey with your own DIY prototype of a "Sprucetron" XPU rendering appliance... that is built with open-source software at the core, off-the-shelf parts, and a rugged spruce frame.

While you don't specifically need a deskside computer shaped like the Sprucetron to enjoy Kartaverse 6, if you do happen to have one, life sure is a lot more fun! Alternatively, the software runs great on a MacBook AIR laptop so you could go with that more sensible and portable option, too.

Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ ships with LuaJIT and FFI scripting support enabled by default since it's awesome and I wouldn't want to leave home without it. ðŸ¤˜
