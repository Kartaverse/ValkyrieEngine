Welcome to Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ â€” The new [Kartaverse 6](https://github.com/kartaverse) hybrid volumetric renderer for pixel-streaming XR experiences without limits.

- Made in West Dover, Nova Scotia, Canada. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- The "Kartaverse Cloud" reboot is planned for [Dec 24, 2024](https://days.to/christmas-eve/2024/12/24).

If you'd like to, you can follow along at home during this development journey with your own DIY prototype of a "Sprucetron" XPU rendering appliance... that is built with open-source software at the core, off-the-shelf parts, and a rugged spruce frame.

Valkyrie Engineâ„¢ ships with LuaJIT and FFI scripting support enabled by default since it's awesome and I wouldn't want to leave home without it. ðŸ¤˜
